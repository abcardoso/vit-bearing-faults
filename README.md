# TransferLearn-CWRU
This project aims to enhance accuracy in bearing fault detection, focusing on the CWRU dataset, specifically in fault severity mode. By leveraging different datasets as source domains, it enables the adaptation of pre-trained models to detect previously unseen fault severities.
